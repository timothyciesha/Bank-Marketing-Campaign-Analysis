# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis - DTI Data Science #02 Final Project

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of a bank marketing campaign dataset. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features.

## 📊 Notebook Summary

Our `main_new.ipynb` notebook contains a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting term deposit subscriptions. We start with exploratory data analysis, clean the data, and build an XGBoost model that achieves 77% precision! 🚀 The model helps identify high-potential customers, reducing wasted calls by 75% and potentially saving ***$111,888*** annually. We also discovered that March is the best month for campaigns, and older individuals (60-65), students, and retirees show higher subscription rates. 💰

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing Campaign dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/benroshan/bank-marketing-campaign-predictive-analytics).
